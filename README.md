# PIC16bitBootHost
A Boot Host for Microchips 16-bit bootloader

This software is intended to be used to help develop a bootloader host that interfaces with Microchip's 16-bit bootloader. The software should be simple enough to understand for the common developer. This software has only been tested with one MCU, the dsPIC33CH. It is not intended as a one stop shop for all MCU's but to help get you started to develop your own host interface and save a day or two of working out some kinks.
